# AltimeterAutoHide

A small mod for KSP that hides the altimeter during flight to safe screen estate.
Move your mouse to the top edge (where the altimeter usually is) to access the recover/abort/gear/etc buttons (See demo image below).
I recommend using mods like [Kerbal Engineer Redux](https://github.com/jrbudda/KerbalEngineer) 
or [MechJeb](https://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2) to display the altitude information in a more space-efficient manner.

## Installing

The easiest way is to install it with CKAN.

For manual installation download the latest release for your version of KSP and unzip the AltimeterAutoHide folder into your GameData directory.
