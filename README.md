# AltimeterAutoHide

Supported KSP Versions: 1.8.0 - 1.10.x

A small mod for KSP that hides the altimeter during flight to save screen estate.
Move your mouse to the top edge (where the altimeter usually is) to access the recover/abort/gear/etc buttons (See demo image below).
I recommend using mods like [Kerbal Engineer Redux](https://github.com/jrbudda/KerbalEngineer) 
or [MechJeb](https://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2) to display the altitude information in a more space-efficient manner.
Works also well with [Draggable Altimeter](https://github.com/andrew-vant/dragalt).
